    """
    Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
    weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds two
    items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your function
    will return an instance of an `Answer` tuple that has the following form:
        (zero, one)
    where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
    The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and the
    smaller index should be placed in the `first` index. If such a pair
    doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return `None`.

    Your solution should run in linear time.
    Example:
        input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
        output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21
